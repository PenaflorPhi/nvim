This is my personal Neovim configuration, designed for efficiency and customization. These are the settings I use for navigation,and my development workflow.

## Installation
Clone the repository and place it in your Neovim config directory:

```bash
git clone -b entropy https://github.com/PenaflorPhi/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
